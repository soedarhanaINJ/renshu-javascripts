In real life, a car is an object.

A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:
All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.

All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

*** Object Properties

The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:

*** Accessing Object Properties

You can access object properties in two ways:

objectName.propertyName

or

objectName["propertyName"]
