<!--    JavaScript Dollar Sign $
        Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:
-->

<p id="y"></p>

<script>
    let $ = "Hello Dilan";
    let $$$ = 56;
    let $myMoney = 7;

    document.getElementById("y").innerHTML = $$$;

    /*
        Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, 
        but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.

        In the JavaScript library jQuery, for instance, the main function $ is used to select HTML elements. 
        In jQuery $("p"); means "select all p elements".
    */
</script>
